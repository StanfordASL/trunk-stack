# 3D Printing

Many of the components for the trunk robot are custom and 3d printed. All of the 3d printed components in the assembly can eaily be printed on any commercial or hobbyist FDM printer. We utilized a Bambu X1C with AMS to print all 3d printed components with PLA, but other materials could alternately be used.

## Printer Settings
On the Bambu X1C, we used default print settings (infill of 15% and 2 wall loops) on the Bambu Cool Plate, with PLA as the primary material, PLA as the support material, and support PLA as the support/raft interface material on all prints except those listed below:
- Pulleys: Printed with PLA-CF, PLA-CF support material, infill of 100% and 5 wall loops
- Trunk Disks: Infill of 30% and 5 wall loops

We found that an offset of 7 thousandths of an inch (0.18 mm) for a friction fit between manufacturer parts and 3d printed parts. For example, if a manufacturer part is friction fit into a custom 3d printed part, and the outer diameter of a manufacturer part is 1.000", then our 3d printed part would have an internal diameter of 1.007". This tolerance may change on other 3d printers, but we found it to be consistent across prints on the Bambu X1C.

## Assets
All 3d printed assets are available in the full CAD assembly. All assets are editable and fully configurable in Fusion360. Please email mleone@stanford.edu if you need access to STL files or other filetypes.
